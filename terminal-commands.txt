Present working directory

```
pwd

```
Use this command any time you are unsure where you are currently in your file structure. pwd stands for Present Working Directory. For Windows,you may either use pwd or cd.

+++++
List files

```
ls

```
Use the ls command to see all the directories and files that are in your current directory. To clear things up, a directory is just a synonym for a folder. In 'cmd', use the dir command instead. 

+++++
List files (long form)

```
ls -l

```
Use the 'ls -l' command to see a long form, representation of the directories and files inside your current directory.

You will see some cryptic messages on the side. The 'drwx' thing that you see are just file permissions for that particular directory or file. For example, the first set of '-'s that follow the 'd' are the permissions allowed for the user. If it says 'rwx' it means the user is allowed to read, write and execute the file. If it just says 'r--' means that the user can only read the file. The second set of three '-'s represent the permissions for a group. The last three '-'s represent the permissions for people who are not the user and are not in the particular group that is allowed. We will have to be changing some of these permissions when we deploy our applications in the cloud. For now, it's important to know that there are different file permissions which can either be read, write, or execute, and these permissions can vary depending on if you are the user, or in the group specified in the listing.

+++++
List all files (long form)

```
ls -a

```
Use the 'ls - a' command to see ALL the files. Linux flavored operating systems hide files that start with a '.' by default. This command will show all the previous files and hidden files if there are any. The files that start with a '.' are often configuration files.

+++++
Changing to the current directory

```
cd .

```
From the previous command, we saw that 'ls - a' will list some interesting file names like '.' and '..' The '.' is reserved to represent the current directory that we are in. If you run the 'cd . ' and then run the 'pwd' command, you'll see that we didn't move to a different directory. We told the computer to change our directory to our current directory which means don't go anywhere! The cd command works well in 'cmd' as well. 

+++++
Changing to the parent directory

```
cd ..

```
Like the 'cd . ' command, the '..' is reserved to represent the parent directory of the current folder that we are in. If you run this command and then run the 'pwd' command, you'll see that we navigated up one directory(folder) structure. If you feel like the File Structure is starting to resemble the DOM (Document Object Model), it's because they are very similar.

+++++
Changing to the root directory

```
cd /

```
This command will change to the root directory of your computer. From this folder, you can access your application folders.

+++++
Changing to any folder

```
cd folder_name

```
The 'cd' command followed by a space and name of the folder you want to access will move you into that directory, if it exists. This example would move you into the 'folder_name' directory.

+++++
Making a new folder

```
mkdir new_directory_name

```
This command will make a new directory named 'new_directory_name'. Whatever argument you pass into this command will be the name of your new file. After making the directory, you could run 'cd new_folder_name' to enter into that directory.

+++++
Delete an empty directory(folder)

```
rm directory_name
//or
rmdir directory_name
```
+++++
Delete a non-empty directory(folder)

```
rm -rf directory_name

```
If you try to delete a folder with contents inside you will get an error! Our computer wants us to say more explicitly to delete this directory and everything inside of it by passing the '-rf' option. Be careful with this command as could it accidentally delete files you didn't intend to delete or delete some config files that you wouldn't want deleted at all! In 'cmd', the command name is del, but the results are the same. 

+++++
Creating a new file

```
touch index.html
touch style.css

```
The 'touch' command will create a new, empty file with the name and extension type that you specify. You can make any type of file if you provide the extension type. Run the above commands, and then run 'ls' and you will see your new files in the listing.

+++++
Removing a file

```
rm index.html

```
The 'rm' command removes any file with the filename and extension provided.

+++++
Renaming/Moving a file

```
mv index.html new_name_index.html
mv new_name_index.html ../new_name_index.html

```
The 'mv' command has two uses. First, you can rename a file by first providing the file's name and then providing what you want the file to be renamed to. In the first example, index.html would be renamed to new_name_index.html. Second, it can be used to move a file to a different folder. In the second example, new_name_index.html would be moved up one directory with the same name. In either case, think of this command as moving a file - into its current directory with a different name or into a different directory with the same or different name.

+++++
Copying a file

```
cp index.html copy.html

```
The 'cp' command will copy a file into the current directory with the new name you provided. In the example, say you were in your Desktop directory and you ran the above command. The Desktop directory would now have index.html and copy.html in it.

+++++
Copying a directory

```
cp -rf directory_name copy_directory_name

```
Copying a directory is similar to a file but we need to pass the '-rf' option in order to copy all the internal contents of the directory. First provide the name of the directory you want to copy and then the name of the copy.

+++++
Opening current directory in your GUI

```
open .

```
The 'open' command will open your current directory in your GUI (in 'cmd' or command prompt, use "start ." instead). Likewise, you could open a file inside your directory by running something like "open file_name". *Note* this command will only work on your local machine, but not on your virtual machine in the Cloud when you are deploying.

+++++
Sudo note

When you are navigating the terminal on your virtual machine in the Cloud, you may encounter these commands throwing back an error. When that happens, prefix your command with 'sudo' which tells the computer that you are the Super User. 'sudo' stands for 'Super User do'. This will become more relevant when we start deploying applications in the cloud, but just know that something like 'sudo' exists.

```
//for example, you can run all the same commands but prefix them with sudo
sudo mkdir test
sudo touch index.html
sudo rm -rf test
```
